 nf_WWA.1.d:0 "The glow of their weapons and the sheen of their metal skin were barely visible through the sandstorm. The beasts were few in number, lumbering through the flat and arid terrain. A smaller beast, lacking the strength of its packmates, stumbled behind, losing his footing on the harsh earth beneath him. The young warrior waited until they passed, snuck behind this weakling, and stole the Sunspitter from his hands. He quickly fired it at the four large ones, each one disintegrating to ash in his wake. Turning on the weakling, he quickly realised that it was a man. Interrogating the young beast-man, he found that this was only a smaller detachment of a larger force located not far from the tribe's main encampment. According to him, they were renegades, criminals to the brotherhood that had banished them, and that he was exiled for something else, but threw his lot in with them out of survival instinct. All that was left to do here was to decide the fate of the surviving warrior."
