This option does nothing, so you do not have both Overdrive and regular Wild Wasteland going. Regular wild wasteland contains bonus events, focus trees, and decisions that don't fit the semi serious tone of the core OWB experience. OVERDRIVE mode has everything basic Wild Wasteland has, plus stuff that are based on non lore sources, more fanfictiony happenings, as well as more widesweeping changes."
